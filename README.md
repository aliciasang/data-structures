# Data Structures Portfolio

This portfolio showcases my work from **DCS 229: Data Structures & Algorithms** at Bates College (Winter 2025). It includes Python implementations of foundational data structures and algorithms, along with performance experiments, visualizations, and reflections.

## Topics Covered

- Linked Lists (singly and doubly linked)
- Stacks and Queues
- Recursion and Sorting
- Priority Queues and Heaps
- Hash Maps and Collisions
- Inheritance and Polymorphism in OOP
- Graph Search Algorithms: BFS, DFS, and A*
- Time complexity and Big-O analysis
- Experimental performance testing in Python

## Structure

Projects are organized by topic folders. Each contains:
- Python implementations
- Visualizations or output files
- Short written reflections (where applicable)
